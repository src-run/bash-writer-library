# [src-run] bash-writer-library

## Overview

[Welcome](https://src.run/go/readme_welcome)!
The `core-library` provides a lightweight collection of core bash functionality, including basic StdIO logic, user- permissions-related logic, and automatic runtime dependency loading logic.

### JTT

This package represents a single project within a
[large collection](https://src.run/go/explore) of open-source code released
under the *Scribe* namespace, comprised of framework-agnostic libraries,
and a number of Symfony bundles. These projects are authored and maintained
by [Rob Frawley 2nd](https://src.run/rmf) and 
[collaborators](https://src.run/bash-writer-library/github_collaborators),
often with the support of [Scribe Inc](https://src.run/go/scribe-home).
